        This AI Assitant is generative AI-powered shopping assistant that enhances customer experience and drives sales through context-aware, AI-powered interactions. 

        #### Key Agent Features:
        - Personalized, Context-Aware Conversations
        - Alternate & Related Product Recommendations
        - Dynamic Side-by-Side Product Comparisons
        - Cart Management & Placing Order
        - Automated Email Confirmations

        #### How It Works
        The Shopping Agent is built using [Agents for Amazon Bedrock](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/agents.html) that uses Anthropic's Claude Sonnet 3 model to interpret user queries and orchestrate multi-step tasks for an efficient shopping experience. 
        - It integrates with a [Knowledge Base for Amazon Bedrock](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/knowledge-bases.html) to embed product catalog details and uses [Amazon OpenSearch Serverless](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/serverless.html) for vector search.
        - An Action Group that utilizes AWS Lambda function with OpenAPI Schema to manage API operations such as order creation, inventory checks, and sending email confirmations.
